description: Map manual test cases (markdown) to source code files and produce a `coverage.manual.yml` mapping consumed by `@testomatio/reporter --filter "coverage:..."`. Use this skill when the user wants to run only the manual tests affected by a code change, generate a manual coverage file, build a traceability matrix between manual cases and source code, or set up change-aware regression for manual QA.

# MANUAL-COVERAGE SKILL: What I do

This skill analyzes **manual test cases in markdown format** and the project source code, then produces `coverage.manual.yml` — a mapping from source files (or globs) to manual test identifiers (suite IDs, test IDs, tags). The mapping is consumed by `@testomatio/reporter run --filter "coverage:file=coverage.manual.yml,diff=<branch>"` to create manual runs in Testomat.io that contain only the cases affected by the diff.

## When to Use

Trigger this skill when the user wants to:
- Map manual test cases to the source code that implements them.
- Generate `coverage.manual.yml` (or a similarly named file) for use with `@testomatio/reporter`.
- Run only manual regression tests relevant to a code change instead of the full suite.
- Build a code → manual-test traceability matrix.
- Find dead manual tests (tests with no matching source) or coverage gaps (source with no manual tests).
- Phrases: "manual test coverage", "map manual cases to code", "affected manual tests", "selective regression for manual tests", "generate coverage.manual.yml".

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS

This skill works **only with manual tests in markdown format**.

- **DO NOT** process unit, functional, or e2e test files.
- **DO NOT** suggest creating new automated tests.
- **Only touch two files in this repo.** This skill runs inside the user's source-code repo. It may write `coverage.manual.yml` (or the path the user gave) and add one `.testeiya/` line to `.gitignore` if it is missing. Nothing else — never a source file. Cases pulled from Testomat.io go into the gitignored `.testeiya/manual-tests/`, never into a tracked folder (see Step 1).
- **Don't write scripts. Never use Python.** Read `.test.md` files with your file tool; pull out IDs and tags with `grep` (Step 2). To check the finished coverage file, pipe it through `js-yaml` into the one tiny bundled helper: `npx js-yaml coverage.manual.yml | node scripts/check-coverage.mjs` (Step 5). If more checks needed use custom script with `npx js-yaml`.

If automated test files (e.g. e2e test, unit, api)  are encountered while exploring, ignore them and continue with the manual markdown set.

## Workflow: Build Manual Coverage Map

### Step 1: Discover the project (delegate to `scan-automation-project`)

Run the **`scan-automation-project`** skill to inventory the project. Use its output as the source of truth for both the manual test set and the high-level codebase overview — do not duplicate that scan here.

From the `scan-automation-project` result, capture:
- **Manual Tests** — the list of `.test.md` files and their suite/test titles (the input to Step 2).
- **Project Overview** — languages, frameworks, complexity (the framing for Step 3).


If `scan-automation-project` reports **no manual tests** (it checks the cache too, so this means nothing was pulled before):
- ❓ Ask the user how to proceed:
  1. Pull cases from Testomat.io — have **`sync-test-cases-with-tms`** pull into the gitignored cache: `npx check-tests pull -d .testeiya/manual-tests`, then add `.testeiya/` to `.gitignore` if missing. Re-run `scan-automation-project` and continue.
  2. Point to a directory the scan missed (then re-run `scan-automation-project` there).
  3. Stop.

Never pull cases into a tracked folder. Don't repeat `sync-test-cases-with-tms` pull logic here.

### Step 2: Extract test information

Each manual test markdown file follows the format described in [Classical Tests Markdown Format](../qa-write-test-cases/references/test-case-format.md) (canonical reference, owned by `qa-write-test-cases`). For every file extract:

- **Suite ID** — `@S` + 8 chars, found in the `<!-- suite ... id: @S... -->` block.
- **Test IDs** — `@T` + 8 chars, found in `<!-- test ... id: @T... -->` blocks.
- **Tags** — `@tag` markers in suite/test titles and `tags:` lines inside the metadata blocks.
- **Context** — suite title, test titles, steps, and expected results — used to reason about which source files implement each behavior.

**How to extract.** Read the `.test.md` files — the metadata blocks are short. For a quick overview, `grep` instead of a parser. Run these in whichever directory holds the cases (`manual-tests/`, or the cache `.testeiya/manual-tests/`):

```bash
grep -rnE 'id:[[:space:]]*@S' <dir>      # suite IDs (+ which file)
grep -rnE 'id:[[:space:]]*@T' <dir>      # test IDs
grep -rnE '^tags:' <dir>                 # tags from metadata blocks
grep -rhoE '@[A-Za-z0-9_-]+' <dir> | sort -u   # every @token (titles included)
```

Don't write a markdown parser. Never use `python`.

If a file has no `@S` / `@T` IDs, the user hasn't pushed it to Testomat.io yet. Ask whether to push first via `sync-test-cases-with-tms`, or skip those files — a mapping without IDs is useless to the reporter.

### Step 3: Explore the codebase

Use the **Project Overview** from Step 1's `scan-automation-project` result (languages, frameworks, complexity) as the starting frame, then identify business code that implements the behaviors described by the manual tests. Skip everything not part of the application — `scan-automation-project` already excludes most of this, but reinforce when reading source:

- Test code: `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `*_test.*`, `test_*.*`, `*.cy.*`, `__tests__/`, `__specs__/`, `tests/`, `spec/`, `specs/`.
- Markdown manual test directories themselves.
- Dependency / build / vendor folders.
- Framework configs and lock files.

Work with the project structure (controllers, models, services, components, pages, routes, etc.) — not the testing infrastructure.

**Templates and views are source code — map them too.** A manual case walks through the rendered UI, so a change to a template alters the screen the tester checks. Treat view/template files as first-class mappable source alongside controllers, models, and components — do **not** skip them because they aren't `.js`/`.ts`/`.py`. Cover at least:

- HTML & component templates: `.html`, `.htm`, `.vue`, `.svelte`, Angular `*.component.html`.
- Logic-in-markup engines: `.hbs`/`.handlebars`, `.ejs`, `.pug`/`.jade`, `.mustache`, `.liquid`.
- Server-side views: `.erb`, `.haml`, `.slim` (Rails); `.blade.php`, `.twig` (PHP); `.j2`/`.jinja`/`.jinja2` (Python); `.cshtml`/`.razor` (.NET); `.jsp` (Java).

Map a template the same way as code: to the suite/test/tag whose manual cases exercise that screen (e.g. `app/views/sessions/new.html.erb` → the login suite).

❓ If the project structure is ambiguous or large (`scan-automation-project` reports `large` / `very-large` complexity), ask the user which directories to focus on or to exclude.

### Step 4: Choose the best mapping per source file

For each candidate source file, pick **one** mapping strategy based on which option gives the cleanest, most stable selection:

**A) Map to Suite (`@S...`)** — when most tests in a suite relate to the file.

```yaml
app/models/user.rb:
  - "@S816410d6"  # Suite: User permissions
```

**B) Map to Test (`@T...`)** — when only one specific test matches the file.

```yaml
app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb:
  - "@T6f8e9174"  # Test: User is blocked after 5 failed login attempts
```

**C) Map to Tag (`@tag`)** — when a tag groups tests across multiple suites that all relate to the file.

```yaml
app/services/jira_service.rb:
  - "@jira"      # Tag: All JIRA integration manual tests
```

**Decision guidance:**
- Prefer Suite mapping over listing many individual Test IDs from the same suite.
- Prefer Test mapping when only one test in a large suite is relevant.
- Prefer Tag mapping when the relevant tests live across several suites.
- Globs (`app/services/jira/**`) are valid file keys when a whole subtree maps to the same identifiers.
- Avoid empty entries.
- Add `#` comments next to each identifier explaining the mapping.

See [Coverage File Format](./references/COVERAGE_FILE_FORMAT.md) for the full YAML grammar.

### Step 5: Save and validate the coverage file

Write the YAML to the resolved output path (default `coverage.manual.yml`). If the user supplied a different path => use it.
(keep `#` comments next to each ID so future readers can audit the mapping without opening Testomat.io).

**Check it** — one command, run from the project root:

```bash
npx js-yaml coverage.manual.yml | node scripts/check-coverage.mjs
```

`npx js-yaml` parses the file (and fails loudly if the YAML is malformed, so a broken file never reaches the script). `check-coverage.mjs` then flags any key whose path is missing on disk, any key with no identifiers, and prints every `@S…` / `@T…` / tag it references. Check that list against the IDs you extracted in Step 2 — only you know which are real. Don't re-parse the markdown; use the set you already have. Never use `python`.

> The keys in the coverage file are paths to source files in this repo, never `.testeiya/...` paths. The cache holds the test cases; the coverage file points at the code they cover.

Then show the produced YAML to the user.

### Step 6: Show next steps

Tell the user how to use the file with `@testomatio/reporter`:

```bash
# Create a pending manual run that includes only cases affected by the diff vs main
npx @testomatio/reporter run \
  --kind manual \
  --filter "coverage:file=coverage.manual.yml,diff=main"
```

For batched regression cycles, recommend grouping runs:

```bash
TESTOMATIO_RUNGROUP="Regression 911" npx @testomatio/reporter run \
  --kind manual \
  --filter "coverage:file=coverage.manual.yml,diff=main"
```

Recommend committing `coverage.manual.yml` to the repository so CI and teammates use the same mapping.

If you pulled the cases, tell the user they stay in the gitignored `.testeiya/manual-tests/`. A re-run or a follow-up question reuses them, and nothing was committed. Don't delete the cache or move it into a tracked folder.

### Step 7: Suggest follow-ups

Once the file is saved, propose any of:

- Scan the source for **coverage gaps** (features without manual tests). On approval, propose new manual cases (delegate to `qa-write-test-cases`).
- Scan for **dead tests** (manual tests whose features no longer exist in source).
- Answer questions like "do we have manual tests for X?" from the cached cases in `.testeiya/manual-tests/`.
- If the user wants to *edit* cases, they can edit them right in `.testeiya/manual-tests/` and push back with `sync-test-cases-with-tms` — gitignored doesn't mean read-only.

## Bundled script

`scripts/check-coverage.mjs` (~25 lines, zero deps) — reads the parsed coverage map on stdin, flags keys whose path is missing on disk and keys with no identifiers, and lists every `@S`/`@T`/tag the file references. Feed it via `js-yaml`, from the project root:

```bash
npx js-yaml coverage.manual.yml | node scripts/check-coverage.mjs
```

It's the only script — everything else is `grep`, your file tool, or `npx js-yaml`. Don't rewrite it in `python`.

---

## Error Handling

### Recovery

- **No manual tests found (cache included)** → have `sync-test-cases-with-tms` pull into `.testeiya/manual-tests/`, or ask the user for a directory the scan missed.
- **Markdown files with no `@S`/`@T` IDs** → ask whether to push first via `sync-test-cases-with-tms`, or skip those files.
- **Ambiguous source layout** → ask the user which directories are application code.

### Hard Fail (stop immediately)

- Cannot create or write the output file.
- User refuses to provide a tests directory or to pull from Testomat.io.
- The agent is asked to modify files other than the output file (refuse — see CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS).

---

## Examples

**Build the mapping in a source repo (cases pulled if needed):**
```
Use qa-manual-tests-to-code-coverage skill to build coverage.manual.yml for our manual cases
```
If there are no local `.test.md` files, it pulls them into the gitignored `.testeiya/manual-tests/` and works from there.

**Cases already local:**
```
Use qa-manual-tests-to-code-coverage skill for the cases in manual-tests/
```

**With a custom output path:**
```
Use qa-manual-tests-to-code-coverage skill, output to ops/coverage.qa.yml
```

**Full workflow (source repo):**
1. `qa-manual-tests-to-code-coverage` runs `scan-automation-project`. No local cases, so it has `sync-test-cases-with-tms` pull into `.testeiya/manual-tests/` (gitignored) and re-runs `scan-automation-project`.
2. It maps source files to suite/test/tag IDs and writes `coverage.manual.yml`. The only tracked changes are that file and one line in `.gitignore`.
3. `npx @testomatio/reporter run --kind manual --filter "coverage:file=coverage.manual.yml,diff=main"` creates a pending run with only the affected cases.
