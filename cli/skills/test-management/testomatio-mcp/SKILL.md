# Testomatio MCP

Set up access to Testomat.io via MCP and run QA analysis workflows: run analysis, failure clustering, root-cause investigation, plan analysis, defect triage.

## When to Use

- Detect or set up the Testomat.io MCP server for an AI agent (Claude, Cursor, OpenCode, etc.).
- Analyze test runs: recent results, success rates, failure trends.
- Investigate failures: group similar failures, find patterns.
- Find the root cause when many tests fail with the same issue.
- Create defects from failed tests in the user's issue tracker (e.g. Jira).

## MCP Tools

- Test: `tests_list`, `tests_get`, `tests_search`
- Test Plan: `plans_list`, `plans_get`, `plans_search`
- Run: `runs_list`, `runs_get`, `runs_search`
- Testrun (results within a run): `testruns_list`, `testruns_get`
- Suite: `suites_list`, `suites_get`, `suites_search`
- Label: `labels_list`, `labels_get`
- Tag: `tags_list`, `tags_get`, `tags_search`

**CRUD tools (create, update, delete) exist for all entities. Use them only when explicitly needed for targeted updates.**

## Rules

- **Prefer local tests over MCP.** If the repo contains markdown test cases (`*.test.md`) or automated test files, read them from the filesystem (or load them via the `sync-test-cases-with-tms` skill) instead of using MCP for full test discovery and analysis.
- Use MCP for:
  - reading and analyzing run reports
  - analytics and reporting
  - test plan management
  - tests that live exclusively in Testomat.io (no local copies), or quick test case searches (`tests_list`, `tests_search`)
  - targeted searches and point updates to remote test cases
- Filter `runs_list`, `plans_list`, `testruns_list` with TQL (Testomat.io Query Language). Operators and examples: [MCP Setup Reference](./references/MCP_SETUP.md).

## Setup

### Step 1: Detect Existing Configuration

Check the user's AI agent config files for a `testomatio` or `mcp.testomatio` entry:
- `opencode.json`
- `.cursor/mcp.json`
- `claude_desktop_config.json`
- other, based on the user's local agent

Validate:
- the server is enabled (when the client supports enable/disable flags)
- `TESTOMATIO_PROJECT_TOKEN` and `TESTOMATIO_PROJECT_ID` are present

Configured and enabled → go to Workflows. Missing, incomplete, or disabled → Step 2.

### Step 2: Configure MCP

Before configuring:
- Prefer confirming the project contains no more than 1000 tests.
- If project size cannot be determined, warn the user about MCP performance limits on large projects.
- **Use only targeted or filtered operations when explicitly requested.**

Credential priority for `TESTOMATIO_PROJECT_TOKEN` and `TESTOMATIO_PROJECT_ID`:
1. Existing environment variables.
2. Existing MCP configuration.
3. User-provided values.

Per-agent config formats (OpenCode, Cursor, Claude Desktop) and where to obtain credentials: [MCP Setup Reference](./references/MCP_SETUP.md).

**Rules:**
- **Do not overwrite unrelated MCP server configurations.** Merge changes carefully with existing config content.
- **Do not expose project tokens, secrets, or credentials in chat responses.**

After successful configuration, confirm with a summary:

```text
Testomat.io MCP configuration completed successfully.

AI Agent: Cursor
Config Updated: `.cursor/mcp.json`
MCP Server: Enabled
Authentication: Verified

Available workflows:
- Test run analysis
- Failure clustering
- Root-cause investigation
- Plan analysis & defect triage
```

## Workflows

Common patterns, not a complete list — adapt and extend to the user's needs. All assume the MCP server is enabled.

### Workflow 1: Analyze Test Runs

Goal: understand the health of recent test execution.

1. Call `runs_list` with `tql` filters (e.g. `finished`, `failed`, `with_defect`); narrow scope by status, environment, or plan.
2. Select a run of interest and call `runs_get` for detailed metadata.
3. Call `testruns_list` with `run_id` and `filter_status: failed` to extract failed results.
4. Summarize: total tests, passed, failed, skipped, environments involved.
   - Compare success/failure ratios across runs to spot regressions.

### Workflow 2: Failure Investigation & Error Clustering

Goal: determine what went wrong and which areas are affected.

1. Call `testruns_list` (`filter_status: failed`, `run_id`) to get failed results.
2. For each failed testrun, call `tests_get` to map it to its suite, priority, tags, and linked issues.
3. Cluster failures:
   - by `suite_id` → identify the suite with the highest failure count
   - by `message` substring → find tests failing with the same exception or assertion
4. Present clusters ranked by count, with suite and message breakdowns and affected test titles.

### Workflow 3: Plan Analysis & Root-Cause Detection

Goal: when many tests fail with the same issue, explain the root cause.

1. Call `plans_get` (if a plan is linked to the run) to understand the intended scope; check whether failures correlate with specific plan sections.
2. Call `runs_list` with `tql` targeting the same plan or environment to get historical runs.
3. Compare failures across runs:
   - increasing failure count → new regression
   - same failures across multiple runs → stable bug or flaky infrastructure
   - spike in a single suite or tag → localized code change, feature regression
   - scattered across unrelated suites → systemic issue (infrastructure, config, dependency)
4. Call `tests_get` on affected tests to check `code`, `state`, and linked issues.
5. Report a root-cause hypothesis.

Example — user asks: "Check why 20 tests failed in the last run — one suite or a systemic issue?"

```text
1. Detecting existing Testomat.io MCP configuration:
   - Found `.cursor/mcp.json`
   - Found `testomatio` MCP server entry
   - MCP server status: enabled

2. Verifying MCP availability...
   - Authentication successful
   - Testomat.io tools available

3. Analyzing latest test run...
   - Retrieved last completed run
   - Total failed tests: 20

4. Failure clustering summary:
   - 16/20 failures belong to suite: "Checkout / Payments"
   - 14 failures share the same error: "Timeout waiting for payment confirmation"
   - First failure timestamp indicates failures started simultaneously

5. Probable root cause:
   - The failures appear systemic rather than test-specific.
   - Most failures point to instability or outage in the payment gateway service used during checkout flows.
```

### Workflow 4: Defect Creation from Failed Tests

Goal: turn recurring failures into trackable defects.

1. Run Workflow 2 to cluster failures by message.
2. If a cluster contains 5+ tests with the same failure:
   - propose creating a defect (e.g. Jira issue) to the user
   - draft the defect summary: title, description, affected test titles, failure messages, run link, environment
   - if a Jira MCP is available, offer to create the ticket via the Jira skill
3. After defect creation, call `tests_issues_link` for each affected test to link it to the defect.
