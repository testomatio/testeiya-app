## PR Requirements Summary

**PR:** Add user export to CSV
**Branch:** feature/PRJ-789-user-export → main
**Type:** feature
**Linked Tickets:** PRJ-789

**Source of Truth:**
- PR description: present (detailed, includes AC checklist and screenshot of the export modal)
- Jira/GitHub ticket: resolved (PRJ-789)
- Most reliable source: PR description + ticket (consistent, no conflicts)

**Changes Overview:** Adds a CSV export action on the user list page that streams all currently filtered users to a downloadable file, with an email notification when exports exceed 10k rows.

**Impacted Areas:**
- User list page UI (new "Export" action).
- User data export pipeline (CSV generation, streaming, email delivery).
- Permission checks for export (admin-only).

**High Level Key files (up to 5):**
- `src/pages/UserList.tsx` — source
- `src/services/ExportService.ts` — source
- `src/api/export.ts` — source
- `src/components/ExportModal.tsx` — source
- `i18n/en.json` — config

**Scope Verification:**
- ✅ In scope: PRJ-789 AC1 (export button on the user list) — addressed in `src/pages/UserList.tsx` and `src/components/ExportModal.tsx`
- ✅ In scope: PRJ-789 AC2 (admin-only) — addressed in `ExportService.ts` permission check
- ⚠️ Out of scope: PRJ-789 AC3 (email notification for >10k exports) — no implementation found
- ➕ Extra (not in ticket): i18n strings for German locale (`i18n/de.json`) — ticket only mentioned English

**Ambiguities, Edge Cases & Open Questions:**
- CSV column order not specified — needs product confirmation.
- Concurrent exports by the same admin — no rate limiting or deduplication specified.
- 50k+ user export (memory/timeout) — no performance budget in the ticket.
- CSV date/time localization (UTC vs. user locale) — not specified.
- Backward compatibility with existing scheduled exports (if any) — not addressed.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Admin opens user list with filters and clicks "Export" → modal appears with row count estimate
- Admin starts export with <10k matching users → CSV downloads with columns `id, name, email, created_at` in that order
- Non-admin opens user list → "Export" action is hidden (or returns 403 via API)
- Admin triggers >10k user export → export is queued, email sent when ready *(NOT IMPLEMENTED — see Scope Verification)*
- User without email is included → email field is empty string in CSV
- Empty filtered list → button disabled OR empty CSV with header only
- 50k+ user export completes without server timeout or OOM
- German admin sees the export modal translated
